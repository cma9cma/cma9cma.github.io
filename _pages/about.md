I am a junior student majoring in Optoelectronic Information at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Currently I am working on computational imaging as a research intern at Intelligent Photonics Group, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. 

I mainly focus on scientific computing in optics and photonics, including computational electromagnetics, image processing, machine learning, and so on.

Research Experiences
------
I have worked on the development of theoretical and computational methods for nanophotonics (See [Publications](https://cma9cma.github.io/publications/)) under the supervision of Prof. Yuntian Chen at HUST. I also participated in the design and simulation of plasmonic devices under the supervision of Prof. Jianjun Lai at HUST.
