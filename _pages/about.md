I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Optoelectronic Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). During my undergraduate studies, I mainly focus on integrated photonic devices (waveguides), nanophotonics (light scattering by nanoscatterers), optical image processing using metasurfaces, and so on. Now I am looking for PhD opportunity in integrated/quantum photonics, nanophotonics, optical computing (on-chip or free-space), or relevant fields in optics and photonics, starting from Fall 2024.

Research Experiences
------
During my undergraduate studies, I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yuntian Chen at HUST. I have worked on the development of theoretical and computational methods for waveguides and light scattering problem (See [Publications](https://cma9cma.github.io/publications/) for more details). 

I have also worked on optical image processing using metasurface, as a research intern at [Prof. Chaoran Huang's group](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~crhuang/), The Chinese University of Hong Kong. These valuable experiences inspire me to do further research on integrated/quantum photonics, nanophotonics, and optical computing.
