I am a final year undergraduate student majoring in Optoelectronic Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Now I am working on optical image processing as a research intern at Intelligent Photonics Group, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. 

I mainly focus on nanophotonics, computational photonics, optical image processing, machine learning, and so on.

Research Experiences
------
I have worked on the development of theoretical and computational methods for nanophotonics (See [Publications](https://cma9cma.github.io/publications/)) under the supervision of Prof. Yuntian Chen at HUST.
