I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Optoelectronic Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Now I am working on optical image processing as a research intern at [Intelligent Photonics Group](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~crhuang/), The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I participate in numerical simulation and data processing in the project.

I mainly focus on nanophotonics (waveguide, metasurface, plasmonics, photonic crystal, etc.), computational electrodynamics, optical image processing, and so on. Now I am looking for Ph.D opportunity in nanophotonics, integrated photonics, bio-imaging, or related fields in optical engineering, starting from Fall 2024.

Research Experiences
------
I have worked on the development of theoretical and computational methods for waveguides and light scattering problem (See [Publications](https://cma9cma.github.io/publications/)) under the supervision of Prof. Yuntian Chen at HUST.
