title: "Simple yet effective analysis of waveguide mode symmetry: generalized eigenvalue approach based on Maxwell’s equations"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'We propose a simple yet effective approach for the analysis of waveguide mode symmetry. In this method, Maxwell’s equations are reformulated into generalized eigenvalue problems. The waveguide eigenmodes are completely determined by the generalized eigenvalue problem given by two matrices (M, N), where M is 6 × 6 waveguide Hamiltonian and N is a constant singular matrix. Based on this approach, we discuss several symmetry operations and the corresponding symmetries including chiral, parity-time reversal, rotation symmetry, etc., wherein the constraints of symmetry requirements on material parameters are derived in a much simpler way.'
