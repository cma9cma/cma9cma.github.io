title: "Efficient and accurate numerical-projection of electromagnetic multipoles for scattering objects"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'In this paper, we develop an efficient and accurate procedure of electromagnetic multipole decomposition by using the Lebedev and Gaussian quadrature methods to perform the numerical integration. Firstly, we briefly review the principles of multipole decomposition, highlighting two numerical projection methods including surface and volume integration. Secondly, we discuss the Lebedev and Gaussian quadrature methods, provide a detailed recipe to select the quadrature points and the corresponding weighting factor, and illustrate the integration accuracy and numerical efficiency (that is, with very few sampling points) using a unit sphere surface and regular tetrahedron. In the demonstrations of an isotropic dielectric nanosphere, a symmetric scatterer, and an anisotropic nanosphere, we perform multipole decomposition and validate our numerical projection procedure. The obtained results from our procedure are all consistent with those from Mie theory, symmetry constraints, and finite element simulations.'
